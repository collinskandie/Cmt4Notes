                        <h2>introduction to  communication and ict</h2>
            <p>communication has improved and  evolved to facilitate out daily activities 
            In the 21st century, everything to do with communication utilities technology to disseminate information to a larger audience.
            Information can be sent out in many ways such as email, Phones, Radio TV Electronic newspaper
            Information refers to knowledge obtained from reading , investigating studying or research
            We need information to make decision and predict the future.
            Communication 
            The act of transmitting messages . Its a process whereby information is exchanged between individuals using symbols , signs  or verbal interactions 
            Communication is important to gain knowledge . With knowledge we are more confident in expressing  our thoughts and ideas
            </p>

            <h2>TECHNOLOGY </h2>
            <p>Use of scientific knowledge experience and resources to create processes and products that fulfill Human needs
            Technology is vital for communication</p>
            
            
            <h2>EVOLUTION OF COMPUTERS</h2>
            
            <h3>First generation  1940 to 1956 </h3>
            <p>They were huge slow expensive and often unreliable</p>
            
            <p>In 1946 Two Americans by the name of Presper Eckert & William Mauchly  Build an  electronic numeric iterator and computer which was ENIAC. And it used vacuum tubes in stead of mechanic switches </p>
            
            <p>In 1941 the two gentlemen built the UNIVAC which could calculator at the rate of 1000 additions per second <br/>
            There were new technologies developed at this stage : <br/>
            i) Vacuum tube – The vacuum tube was n important advancement <br/>
                                        an electronic tube about the size of a light bulb was used for internal computer  <br/>  			     components and were used in thousands 
            ii) Punched Card –  This was used  to store data <br/>
            iii)Magnetic Tape – This was introduced in 1957 It was faster and more compact method of storing data 	<br/>		     and their use was more reliable & cost effective 
                        (Floppy Disk)</p>
            
            
            <h3>CHALLENGES </h3>
            <p>i)Vacuum tubes generated a lot of heat causing many problems in temperature regulation and climate control <br/>
            ii)The tubes burnt out frequently 
            Challenge with programming machines </p>
            
            
            <h3>Second Generation 1956 1963</h3>
            
            
            <p> There were three main scientists involved in the second generation John Barden , Walter  Houser Brattain & William Shockley 
            Creation of transistors sparked the production of a second generation computers 
            Transistors were small devices used to transfer small  electronic signals across a resistor
            Transistors had many advantages compared to other</p>
            
            <h3>Advantages </h3>
            <p>i)Smaller than the vacuum tubes 
            Needed no warm up time <br/>
            ii)Consumed less energy <br/>
            iii) Generated less heat <br/>
            iv) Faster and more reliable</p>
            
            <h3>Third Generation 1964 1971</h3>
            
            <p>in This era the IBM 370 series was introduced in 1964
            It came in several models and sizes
            The development of integrated circuits signals the beginning of the third generation of computers
            Silicon chips were manufactured in 1961 in the silicon valley
            Integrated Circuits Technology reduced the size and cost of computers 
            IC’s Complete electronic circuit with a small chip of silicon which is used as a semiconductor
            Magnetic core memory was replaced by the Microchip 
            It was during this generation the first 256 bit ram was introduced </p>
            
            <h3>Advantages </h3>
            <p>i)The silicon chips were reliable cheaper and compact hardware and software were now sold separately 
                and thus the software industry was created <br/>
            ii)Customer service industry flourished </p>
            
            
            <h3>Fourth Generation 1971 to Present </h3>
            
            <p>It took 55 years for the generation to evolve the growth of the computer industry developed technologies for computer inventions (hardware  && software)
            There are many types of computer models that developed eg IBM, DELL, ACER etc <br/>
            In 1971 Intel created the first microprocessor <br/>
            In 1976 Steve jobs created apple computer <br/>
            In 1981 IBM built the first personal computer <br/>
            Hardware technologies such as silicon chips, microprocessor and storage devices were invented </p> 
            
            <h3>Advantages </h3>
           <p> I) The computer became 100times smaller than the first computer ENIAC <br/>
            ii) There was an improvement in speed reliability and capacity <br/>
            iii) Personal computers and software industry boomed</p>
            
           <h3>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond)</h3> 
            
           <p>The computers are technologically advanced and are still being developed to become more efficient
            The invention of this hardware tech has grown rapidly including many mordern computer devicessuch as silicon chips processors  Robotics VR Intelligent Systems  
            <br/><br/>
            After the 5th Generation the the of computer has become more advanced  modern and sophisticated 
            with the latest invention in this era including (Mobile computers Main Frames Mobiles)</p>

            <h2>Computerised vs Non-Computerised</h2>
            <p>
            A system is an arrangement of elements that have been put together  in order to achieve an organized and established  goal 
            A system  therefore consists  of components connected together in order to facilitate the flow of information , matter or energy
            
            A computer system consists of a set of hardware or software that processes data in a meaningful way to produce information

                Pligarism <br/>
                <h3>Computer Ethics</h3>
                There are three major areas <br/>
                Copyright<br/>
                Netiquette<br/> 
                Daay to Day ethic<br/>
               Intellectual Property: Creation of intellect i.e Inventions Neutral and artistic works Symbols Name sImages and designs <br/>
                    It is divided into 
                    i)Industrial property: Protects inventions <br/>
                    ii) Copyright:Protects Litteral and artistic work<br/>




            <h3>Netiquette are the verious   relating to usage of the internet  Its about proper ways to use a network and determine whether the information is reliable While emphasising Four important factors 
                i) Real people exist behind the computers 
                    -> It is important to consider that as you send in the chat window remember you are dealing with people not machines (Think Twice)
                    -> REmeber you are not the one using the network/Internet 
                    > Keep other people in mind as you share sth on the network /interne =-t 
                ii) Protect your private data 
                    ->  Just as you would in the real world take note 
                    fraud 
                    false info on the internet 
                    Use common sense to determine whether the info is valid
                    Dont further spread information with which you are in doubt.
                    Always try not to further spread unreliable info 
                    Protect your personal information To acoid malicious activities on the data 

                iii) Spamming : Sending of unsolicited  bulk and/or commercial messages over the internet 
                    -> It is morally bad as it is intended to destroy and done by infringing on the right of privacy by others 
                    -> It is good  that the message sent benefits the recipient
