                -Analogous to training a child to walk.<br/>
                
               <h3> Regression<br/></h3>
                -------------
                -Similar to supervised learning accept  that you give a concrete known examples to the<br/>
                computer.<br/>
                
              <h3>  Classification </h3>
                ---------------
                -You classify objects of similar nature into a single groups.<br/>
                
              <h3>  Unsupervised learning</h3>
                ---------------------
                -Do not  specify a target variable to the machine, rather we ask machine what it can tell about a<br/>
                specific object.<br/>
                -To reach at this point the is a large number  of dataset  points that  the machine would require to <br/>
                deduce .<br/>
                -For the case of supervised a machine need to be trained with even few thousands of data points.<br/>
                -For the cause of unsupervised learning, the number of data point that is reasonable <br/>
                accepted for learning start in a few millions.<br/>
                -data idealy requires  curating.<br/>
                -Data Curating - is the organisation and integration  of data collection from various source.<br/>
                                - It involve annotation, publication and presentation of data such that the value of the data is maintained over time.<br/>
                                    and data remains available  for reuse and preservation.<br/>
                                    
             <h3>   Reinforcement learning </h3>
                ----------------------
                -Initially developed for machine to play Games.<br/>
                -The machine is given an algorithm  to analyze all possible moves at each  stage of the game.<br/>
                -The machine can select one of the move at random.<br/>
                -If the move is right,  the machine is rewarded, otherwise it may be penalized.<br/>
                -Slowly the machine started differenciating between right and wrong moves.<br/>
                -After a several iteration it started it would learn to solve the game puzzle with a better accuracy.<br/>
                -The accuracy of winning the game would improve as  the machine plays more and more games.<br/>
                
                
              <h3>  How does the supervised learning different from the  reinforcement learning </h3>

                    -----------------------------
                -E-mail filter program  without using ml step by step
                    1.identify how the spam email looks like.
                    2.write algorithm to detect the pattern that you have seen.
                    3.test the program and then make changes to the program until the results are good enough.
                    -THe software flag woud flag the email as spam if certain numbers of those pattern are detected
                    -if the case requires a long list of rules to find the solution it is suitable for ML to come in.
                    -if in any case the email sender change email template, program need to update it manually.
                    unlike the ML which will detect this automatically, and adapt to new data.

                -It involve the following steps:
                                    Getting the dataset
                                    importing libraries
                                    importing datasets
                                    fnding missing data
                                    Encoding categorical Data
                                    splitting dataset into training and test set
                                    Feature scaling.
                                    
                
                
                
              <h3>  Getting the datasets</h3>
                ----------------------
                -requires since a machine requires data to work.
                -Dataset - is a prober formated collection of data for a particular problem.
                        -It may be of differnt format for differnt purpose.
                        - should be put into a csv file in  order to use it our code(also HTML or xlsx file)
                        
                        
              <h3>  What is a CSV file</h3>
                -----------------------
                -Stands for Comma-separated value.
                -It is a file format which allows us to save the tabular data, such as speedsheet.
                -It is useful for huge datasets used in programming.
                -Dataset can also be created by gathering data  using various API with python and should be put into .csv file.
                
                
                
              <h3>  Importing libraries</h3>
                --------------------------
                -Used to perform specific jobs.
                -The specific libraries   used in data preprocessing:
                            numpy - used for including any type of mathematical operation in the code.
                                    - it is  a fundamental package for scientific calculation.
                                    - support also adding large, multidimensional array  and matrics.
                                    - import numpy as nm
                        matplotlib - is a python 2D plotting library.
                                    - With it we need to import a sub-library pyplot.
                                    -used to plot any type of chart in python.
                                    -import matplotlib.pyplot as mpt
                    pandas   -  One of the most famous python library.
                                -used to manage datasets.
                                -It is an open-source data manipulation and analysis library.
                                -import pandas as pd.

                -procedure:
                            import the datasets which we have collected  for our machine learning project.
                            Before that set a working directory in spyder IDE.
                            save your python file  in the directory which contains dataset
                            Go to file explore option in spyder IDE, and select the required directory.
                            Click on F5  button or run option to execute the file.
                            n/b we can set any directory as a working directory, but must contain the required dataset.

               <h3> Simple Linear regrassion in machine learning </h3>
                --------------------------------------------------
                -A type of algorithm that model the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
                -This relation is  linear or a sloped straight line, hence called simple linear regression.
                -It has two main objective:
                            1.Model a relationship bewteen the two variable. - ie relationship between income and expenditure, experience and salaries.
                            2.Forecasting new observations - ie weather forecasting according to temperature, revenue of a company according to the investment in a year.

                -Take a dataset that has two variables.
                -Salary(dependant variable) and experience(independent variable)
                -The goal of the problems is to -find out if the is any relationship  between these two variables.
                                                -Find the best fit for the dataset.
                                                -How the depenfent  variables is changing by changing the dependent variable.
                                                
                -steps:
                      <h3>  1 - Data pre-processing </h3>
                        --------------------------
                    -import the three important libraries, which will help us for loading the dataset,
                    plot the graph, and create  the simple lenear regression model.
                            import numpy as nm
                            import matplotlib.pyplot as mtp
                            import pandas as pd
                -load the dataset into our code.
                            data_set = pd.read_csv('salary_Data.csv')
                -Execute the above line of code(ctrl+ENTER) 
                -read the dataset on our spyder IDE screen by clicking on the variable explorer option
                -It will show the data dataset which has two variables. salary and expence.
                -N/b floder containing the code file must be saved as a working directory and thedataset  or csv file should be in he same folder.
                -Extract the dependent and independent variables  form the given daaset.
                -the independent variable  is year of experience, and dependent variable is salary.
                                x = data_set.iloc[:,:-].values
                                y = data_set.iloc[:,1].values
                - -1 removes the last column from the dataset.
                -We can see the x (independent) variable and y(dependent) variable has been extracted from the given daaset.
                -We can spit dataset  so that we can train the model using a teaining dataset and ten test the 
                    dataset 
                                #spitting the dataset into training and test set.
                                from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
                                x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_slit(x,y,test_size=1/3, random_state=0)
                -By executing above code, we ill get x-test, x-train and y-test, y-train dataset.
                -for simple linear regression, we will not use feature  scaling.Because python libraries take care of it for some cases.
                - The dataset  is well prepared to work on it and we are going to start building a simple linear regresssion  model for a given problem.
