            <h1>CMT 413 NETWORK AND SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION</h1>

            <h2>Applying technology in an environment </h2>

                <p> → The key task of network and system administration is to build the hardware configurations and the other  is to configure software systems <br/>
                → Both of these tasks(Hardware and Software configure software systems <br/>
                → Both of these functions presents their own challenges i.e  hardware configuration challenges and none of these challenges can be considered in isolation <br/>
                → The hardware must conform to the constraints of the physical world <br/>
                → Such challenges include : power, climate <br/>
                → The kind of hardware limits the software that can run on it <br/>
                → The hardware constraints affect the performance to basic standards in order to work systematically <br/>
                → For software configuration, basic operating system, infrastructure are key to conformance standards <br/>
                → Modern software in the context of global network  need to interact and survive possible hostilities of the incompatible  or inhospitable competitors <br/>
                → Today the complexity of multiple software systems sharing a common internet space reaches almost the level of the biological <br/>
                → In today’s networks, our focus is not only in the physical environment but the technology environment <br/>
                →The challenge with the technology environment is that it is constantly changing <br/>
                → we apply technology in these changing environments for the purposes of running businesses and other practices <br/>
                → The global view presented to us by IT  means that we have to think on penetration for the systems that are going to be deployed <br/>
                → The extensive filaments of our inter-networked systems are exposed to attacks both accidental and malicious in a competitive jungle <br/>
                → If you ignore the environment you expose then organization you IT assets to an immeasurable risk <br/>

                <h3>The Human Role in Systems </h3>

                → For the part of the human tasks of the system administration is a very careful balancing task <br/>
                → This task quires patience knowledge  understanding and experience <br/>
                → The human tasks in systems can be compared to be equivalent to working in a casualty ward in hospitals <br/>
                → despite this diamante system admins work with limited resources and computer systems are subjected to entropy <br/>
                * As a system admin you must recognize that answers are not always written down for you to copy <br/>
                → One important aspect for a system  designer and admin is to remain calm when problems happen and attentive and moreover he/she must continually keep learning because of the changing environment <br/>
                → Computing systems require the very best of organization skill at the most professional of attitudes <br/>
                → In order for us to become very good system admin we must learn the facts that build confidence through expertise and experience, However you must be aware of our limitations to avoid careless mistakes which are too easy to commit <br/>

                Discipline –<br/>
                </p>
                <h3>Challenges for System administrators</h3>
                <p>
                → Deciding what services are needed <br/>
                → Designing a network which is logical and efficient<br/>
                → Providing a comfortable environment for the users<br/>
                → Deploying large no of machines which can be upgraded  later<br/>
                → Planning and implementing adequate security <br/>
                → Developing Ways of fixing errors and problems which occur <br/>
                → Keeping track of and understanding use of the enormous amount of knowledge which increases every year</p>
