And it used vacuum tubes in stead of mechanic switches </p>\n            \n            <p>In 1941 the two gentlemen built the UNIVAC which could calculator at the rate of 1000 additions per second <br/>\n            There were new technologies developed at this stage : <br/>\n            i) Vacuum tube – The vacuum tube was n important advancement <br/>\n                                        an electronic tube about the size of a light bulb was used for internal computer  <br/>  \t\t\t     components and were used in thousands \n            ii) Punched Card –  This was used  to store data <br/>\n            iii)Magnetic Tape – This was introduced in 1957 It was faster and more compact method of storing data \t<br/>\t\t     and their use was more reliable & cost effective \n

\n            <p>in This era the IBM 370 series was introduced in 1964\n            It came in several models and sizes\n            The development of integrated circuits signals the beginning of the third generation of computers\n            Silicon chips were manufactured in 1961 in the silicon valley\n            Integrated Circuits Technology reduced the size and cost of computers \n            IC’s Complete electronic circuit with a small chip of silicon which is used as a semiconductor\n            Magnetic core memory was replaced by the Microchip \n            It was during this generation the first 256 bit ram was introduced </p>\n            \n            <h3>Advantages </h3>\n            <p>i)The silicon chips were reliable cheaper and compact hardware and software were now sold separately \n                and thus the software industry was created <br/>\n            ii)Customer service industry flourished </p>\n            \n            \n            <h3>Fourth Generation 1971 to Present </h3>\n            \n            <p>It took 55 years for the generation to evolve the growth of the computer industry developed technologies for computer inventions (hardware  && software)\n            There are many types of computer models that developed eg IBM, DELL, ACER etc <br/>\n            In 1971 Intel created the first microprocessor <br/>\n            In 1976 Steve jobs created apple computer <br/>\n            In 1981 IBM built the first personal computer <br/>\n            Hardware technologies such as silicon chips, microprocessor and storage devices were invented </p> \n            \n            <h3>Advantages </h3>\n           <p> I) The computer became 100times smaller than the first computer ENIAC <br/>\n            ii) There was an improvement in speed reliability and capacity <br/>\n            iii) Personal computers and software industry boomed</p>\n            \n           <h3>Fifth Generation (Present and Beyond)</h3> \n            \n           <p>The computers are technologically advanced and are still being developed to become more efficient\n            The invention of this hardware tech has grown rapidly including many mordern computer devicessuch as silicon chips processors  Robotics VR Intelligent Systems  \n            <br/><br/>\n            After the 5th Generation the the of computer has become more advanced  modern and sophisticated \n            with the latest invention in this era including (Mobile computers Main Frames Mobiles)</p> \n            \n            \n            <h4>Usage of ICT

cognitive development\n            Teachers use computers to research teaching material , participate in online forums, as well as AIDING THEIR TEACHING\n            Students use computers as reference tools \n            Researches use computers to collect data \n            School admins use computers for administrative purposes to ensure smooth operation\n            </p>\n            \n            <h3>•\tBanking</h3>\n            \n            The computer is the nerve system of the banking sector It functions to control the banking system\n            Banking provide 24hr services (ATM Check deposit E-transfer , Direct deposit)\n            Customers are able to make transactions at 24hr service centers or via online , These services allow customers to transact at any time at any place \n            Business men are able to access company accounts for loan applications business transactions update cash flow at any time \n            Bank admin can oversee banking activities such as inter-branch transfer etc by referring to the banking system\n            \n            <h3>•\tIndustry</h3>\n            <p>Computers are used to facilitate production, planning and ctrl system that support chain management  and helping product design\n            Workers researchers and admins benefit on the use of ict \n            Workers use machines that are connected to computers to operate.\n            In some production robots are used to take over jobs that are risky to provide more efficiency\n            Researchers use computers to analyze and collect research data for future reference \n            Admins use computers to oversee entire operations in a factory or plant to detect specific errors or defects that occur in the process</p> \n            \n            \n           <h3> •\tE-commerce</h3>\n            <p> Helps in boosting the economy It makes buying and selling activities easier and more efficient and faster. \n            In the ecommerce

technology in an environment </h2>\n\n                <p> → The key task of network and system administration is to build the hardware configurations and the other  is to configure software systems <br/>\n                → Both of these tasks(Hardware and Software configure software systems <br/>\n                → Both of these functions presents their own challenges i.e  hardware configuration challenges and none of these challenges can be considered in isolation <br/>\n                → The hardware must conform to the constraints of the physical world <br/>\n                → Such challenges include : power, climate <br/>\n                → The kind of hardware limits the software that can run on it <br/>\n                → The hardware constraints affect the performance to basic standards in order to work systematically <br/>\n                → For software configuration, basic operating system, infrastructure are key to conformance standards <br/>\n                → Modern software in the context of global network  need to interact and survive possible hostilities of the incompatible  or inhospitable competitors <br/>\n                → Today the complexity of multiple software systems sharing a common internet space reaches almost the level of the biological <br/>\n                → In today’s networks, our focus is not only in the physical environment but the technology environment <br/>\n                →The challenge with the technology environment is that it is constantly changing <br/>\n                → we apply technology in these changing environments for the purposes of running businesses and other practices <br/>\n                → The global view presented to us by IT  means that we have to think on penetration for the systems that are going to be deployed <br/>\n                → The extensive filaments of our inter-networked systems are exposed to attacks both accidental and malicious in a competitive jungle <br/>\n                → If you ignore the environment you expose then organization you IT assets to an immeasurable risk <br/>\n\n                <h3>The Human Role in Systems </h3>\n\n                → For the part of the human tasks of the system administration is a very careful balancing task <br/>\n                → This task quires patience knowledge  understanding and experience <br/>\n                → The human tasks in systems can be compared to be equivalent to working in a casualty ward in hospitals <br/>\n                → despite this diamante system admins work with limited resources and computer systems are subjected to entropy <br/>\n                * As a system admin you must recognize that answers are not always written down for you to copy <br/>\n                → One important aspect for a system  designer and admin is to remain calm when problems happen and attentive and moreover he/she must continually keep learning because of the changing environment <br/>\n                → Computing systems require the very best of organization skill at the most professional of attitudes <br/>\n                → In order for us to become very good system admin we must learn the facts that build confidence through expertise and experience, However you must be aware of our limitations to avoid careless mistakes which are too easy to commit <br/>\n                </p>\n\n
